# Introduction

This repository is a reimplementation of the VLOAM algorithm [1]. The LOAM/Lidar Odometry part is adapted and refactored from ALOAM [2], and the Visual Odometry part is written according to the DEMO paper [3].

The following figure [1] illustrates the pipeline of the VLOAM algorithm.
